# Pomodoro Clock :alarm_clock:	

## What is this project? :bulb:

This app is a pomodoro clock that provides a way to set your work time and rest time, and alerts you when the time is 00:00. Then it automatically switch to the work/rest time and starts counting again. Just set your times, and click on the play button to start the timer!
